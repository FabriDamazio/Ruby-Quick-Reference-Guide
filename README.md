### Backslash notations
(also ''escaped characters')
```ruby
\n                  # Newline (0x0a)
\r                  # Carriage return (0x0d)
\f                  # Formfeed (0x0c)
\b                  # Backspace (0x08)
\a                  # Bell (0x07)
\e                  # Escape (0x1b)
\s                  # Space (0x20)
\x                  # Character x``
\nnn                # Octal (n = 0-7)
\xnn                # Hesadecimal (n = 0-9, a-f, A-F)
\cx, \C-x           # Control-x
\M-x                # Meta x; usually used for keyboard/terminal control
\M-\C-x             # Meta-Control-x; usually used for keyboard/terminal control
\unnnn              # Unicode code point U+nnnn (Ruby 1.9+)
puts "ln1\nln2"     # Newline (0x0a); prints two lines
puts "n123\rab"     # Carriage return (0x0d); prints one line, "ab23"
puts "f12\f345"     # Formfeed (0x0c); prints two lines, offset
puts "abc\bx"       # Backspace (0x08); prints 'abx'
puts "bell\a\a\a"   # Bell (0x07); prints 'bell' and rings bell three times
puts "ab\ecd"       # Escape (0x1b); prints 'abd'
puts "ab\scd"       # Space (0x20); prints 'ab cd'
puts "ab\xcd"       # Character x; prints 'abxcd'
puts "ab\015x"      # Octal (n = 0-7); prints 'xb', same as \r
puts "ab\xdx"       # Hesadecimal (n = 0-9, a-f, A-F); prints 'xb', same as \r

### Percent Literals
```ruby
# can use any paired delimiters
# Uppercase versions (as in %I, %Q) allow interpolation and escaped characters
baz = "abc"
%I{foo bar #{baz}}  # Array of Symbols: [:foo, :bar, :abc]
%i{foo bar #{baz}}  # Array of Symbols: [:foo, :bar, :"\#{baz}"]
%q(use a " here}    # Strings: "use a \" here"
%{...}              # Alternative Strings notation
%r                  # RegExp: "this is a fixit"
  "this is a test".sub(%r{t??t}, 'fixit'})
%s{fancy symbol}    # Symbol: :"fancy symbol" (not recommended)
%w{foo bar baz}     # Array of Strings: ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
%x{cat __FILE__}    # Backtick: the contents of the current file
```

### HERE Docs
```ruby
str1 = <<EODOC
This is some data to 
go into
the str1 variable
EODOC
puts str1       # Exact text, with carriage returns, in str1

str2 = <<-INDENTED
  More dumnmy text, indented.
  Leading spaces are included in the output
  #{str1} - yes, interpolation is supported
  INDENTED
puts str2       # Exact text including indent spaces; HERE marker can be indented

str3 = <<"***"
You can use special characters,
enclosed in quqotes.
***
puts str3       # Exact text

str4 = <<~SQUIGGLY_DOC
  The tilde '~" modifies the indentation
  of the text. The leading spaces of the
  least-indented line are removed from all lines.
    This line will be indented two spaces.
SQUIGGLY_DOC
puts str4       # Modified indentation, as noted in the text

str5 = <<'NO_INTERPOLATION'
Enclosing the HEREDOC identifier in
sinqle quotes means no interpolation,
so #{str4} is printed character-for-character.
puts str5       # HEREDOC with no interpolation

str6 <<`BACKTICKS`
cat #{__FILE__}
BACKTICKS
puts str6       # Prints the results of the cat command
```

### Arrays
```ruby
array = []                            # Array; zero-based indexing
array = Array.new(5)                  # Array with size 
array = Array.new(2, "abc")           # ["abc", "abc"]
array = Array(0..9)                   # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
first_item = array.first              # Array first item
first_item = array[0]                 # Array first item
last_item = array.last                # Array last item
last_item = array[array.size - 1]     # Array last_item
array.size                            # Array size
array.length                          # Array size
array.count                           # Array size
array.at(5)                           # Element at index 5
array.push(42)                        # Add 42 to end of array
array.pop                             # Remove last element from array
array.shift                           # Remove first element from array
array.unshift(15)                     # Add 15 to beginning of array
array.methods.sort - Object.methods   # List all Array instance methods
array = %w{a b c #{num}}              # ["a", "b", "c", "\#{num}"]
array = %W{a b c #{num}}              # ["a", "b", "c", "5"] (if num = 5)

### Hash

```ruby
hash = {}                         # New Hash without default value
hash = Hash.new("default_value")  # New hash with a default value for any key
hash.default = "another_value"    # Changes default value
hash.size                         # Hash size
hash.length                       # Hash size
hash.count                        # Hash size
hash[1]                           # Get the value or default if key not found
hash.clear                        # Removes all key-value pairs from hash
hash.delete(1)                    # Deletes a key-value pair by key
hash.empty?                       # Test if hash is empty (true or false)
hash.invert                       # New hash with inverted key-value pairs
hash.values                       # Returns a new array containing all the values of hash.

### Operators
```ruby
# Arithmetic Operators
a + b           # Adition
a - b           # Subtraction
a * b           # Multiplication
a / b           # Division
a % b           # Modulus
a**b            # Exponent

# Comparison Operators
a == b          # Checks if the value of two operands are equal
a != b          # Checks if the value of two operands are different
a > b           # Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand
a < b           # Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand
a >= b          # Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand
a <= b          # Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand
a <==> b        # Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if greater and -1 if less
(1...10) === 5  # Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement
a.eql?(b)       # Check if the type and value are equals
a.equal?b       # Check if the the objects have the same id

# Logical Operators
a && b          # "and" operator (higher precedence)
a and b         # "and" operator 
a || b          # "or" operator (higher precedence)
a or b          # "or" operator 
!a              # Negation operator (higher precedence)
not a           # Negation operator

# Bitwise Operators
a = 60          # 0011 1100 in binary format
b = 13          # 0000 1101 in binary format
------------------
a&b             # 0000 1100
a|b             # 0011 1101
a^b             # 0011 0001
~a              # 1100 0011

# Parallel Assignment
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30  # a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
a, b = b, c           # Swapping the values

# Ternary Operator
true ? "true" : "false"   # Result is "true"

### Ranges
```ruby
(1..10)                     # Creates a range from 1 to 10 inclusive
(1...10)                    # Creates a range from 1 to 9
('a'..'d')                  # 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
(1..10).to_a                # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
('bar'..'bat').to_a         # ["bar", "bas", "bat"]

# Range methods
range1 = (1..10)            # Creates a range from 1 to 10 inclusive
range1.include?(5)          # Return true
range1.min                  # Return the min value
range1.max                  # Return the max value
range1.reject {|i| i < 5 }  # Return [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

### Strings
```ruby
'Simple string literal'         # Simple string literal
myString = String.new("TEST")   # Create an instance of String object
foo = myString.downcase         # Return a downcased copy of the string
foo = myString.upcase           # Return a upcased copy of the string
foo = myString.capitalize       # First character converted to uppercase
foo = myString.capitalize!      # Convert the first character to uppercase and the remainder to lowercase.
